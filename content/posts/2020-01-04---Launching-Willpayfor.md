###Why?
If like me, you keep a list of ideas and solutions to needs and problems you've either experienced yourself or you're
familiar with in a way. You also probably imagine that one day you'll build it yourself or try to monetize it somehow.
Unfortunately, life is simply too short to fulfill all those ideas. Sharing the ideas with others while specifying how valuable
they might be in my perspective could help validate their need and increase their chances to see light one day.
So I've built Willpayfor.com so I can manage my ideas list there, and hopefully more makers & thinkers will join
