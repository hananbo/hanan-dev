10 years to NODE.js and we still lack a worthy wholistic application framework like laravel/rails/django.

  

What is wholistic framework, what does it give out of the box, go through laravel docs

  

  

pros: rad, rapid application development, link to presentation, stable and maintained dependencies, cons: monolithÂ , performance.
